        <h2> Story </h2>
        <p>
            The date of the emergence of Belarusian statehood is considered to be January 1, 1919, when the Manifesto of the Provisional Workers' and Peasants' Government of Belarus proclaimed the Belarusian Socialist Soviet Republic within the RSFSR. The proclamation of the Executive Committee of the Belarusian People's Republic of the Rada of the All-Belarusian Congress, which preceded this on March 9, 1918, did not lead to the creation of full-fledged functioning authorities due to the German territory of Belarus

            In 1922, the BSSR became part of the Soviet Union. In March 1924, the USSR Central Executive Committee decided to transfer 15 districts and individual volosts of the Vitebsk, Gomel and Smolensk provinces to the BSSR.

            In the 1920s and 1930s, industrialization processes were actively underway in Soviet Belarus. By the beginning of industrialization, 3.4% of the population lived in the BSSR and only 1.6% of the industrial output of the USSR was produced. The light, food, woodworking and chemical industries developed everywhere, starting with the second Five-Year Plan - mechanical engineering and the production of building materials. Over the 3 five-year plans, industrial production in the BSSR increased 23 times.

        <h2>Economy</h2>
        <p>
            Belarus is a moderately developed industrial-agrarian state. The economy in Belarus is built on the principles of a socially oriented market model. The structure of the Belarusian economy is characterized by the predominance of state ownership in the production, energy, transport, mining, construction, agricultural and banking sectors, and a small share of the private sector. There is no centralized distribution and planning, except for macroeconomic indicators. The state regulates prices for socially significant groups of goods.

        <p>
            The country has developed energy, mechanical engineering, agriculture, chemical, forestry and mining industries, construction and production of building materials. The problem of Belarus is the lack of open sources of hydrocarbons (for example, oil production in 2012 amounted to 1.66 million tons), as a result of which a significant part of the oil and gas has to be imported. The republic also has an impressive and constantly growing external public debt (17.8 billion US dollars as of August 1, 2020) and fairly high inflation by European standards. Belarus spends significant amounts of money on payments on public debt - 6.8 billion rubles or 34% of the republican budget in 2019, however, the main amount of it is refinanced; the cost of servicing public debt as a result in 2019 amounted to 2.34 billion rubles.
